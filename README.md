# RAJKSummarizer
A telegram bot that **summarizes messages** from the user's selected telegram **channels and groups**, using openAI's GPT API.

## Project Motivation

Have you experienced a situation where you have groups or channels with **days' worth of unread messages**, and you're **too lazy to read** through these messages but **still want to know** the gist of what's happening?
We definitely have, often enough that we wanted to have a quick, easy way to summarize the information in these chats.
